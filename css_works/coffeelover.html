                <b>History of Coffee:</b>According to one legend, ancestors of today's Oromo people in a region of Jimma
                in
                Ethiopia were the first to recognize the energizing effect of the coffee plant. However, no direct
                evidence that has been found earlier than the 15th century indicating who among the African populations
                used
                it as a stimulant, or where coffee was first cultivated. The story of Kaldi, the 9th-century Ethiopian
                goatherd who discovered the stimulating effect of coffee when he noticed how excited his goats became
                after
                eating the beans from a coffee plant, did not appear in writing until 1671 and is probably apocryphal.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another legend attributes the discovery of coffee to a Sheikh Omar. According to an old chronicle
                (preserved in the Abd-Al-Kadir manuscript), Omar, who was known for his ability to cure the sick through
                prayer, was once exiled from Mocha in Yemen to a desert cave near Ousab (modern-day Wusab, about 90
                kilometres (56 mi) east of Zabid, Yemen). Starving, Omar chewed berries from nearby shrubbery but
                found them to be too bitter. He tried roasting the seeds to improve the flavor, but they became hard. He
                then tried boiling them to soften the seed, which resulted in a fragrant brown liquid. Upon drinking the
                liquid, Omar was revitalized and sustained for days. As stories of this "miracle drug" reached Mocha,
                Omar was asked to return and was made a saint.

                <b>Coffee Cultivation:</b>The traditional method of planting coffee is to place 20 seeds in each hole at
                the beginning of the rainy season. This method loses about 50% of the seeds' potential, as about half
                fail to sprout. A more effective process of growing coffee, used in Brazil, is to raise seedlings in
                nurseries that are then planted outside at six to twelve months. Coffee is often intercropped with food
                crops, such as corn, beans, or rice during the first few years of cultivation as farmers become familiar
                with its requirements. Coffee plants grow within a defined area between the tropics of Cancer and
                Capricorn, termed the bean belt or coffee belt.

                Of the two main species grown, arabica coffee (from C. arabica) is generally more highly regarded than
                robusta coffee (from C. canephora). Robusta coffee tends to be bitter and have less flavor but better
                body than arabica. For these reasons, about three-quarters of coffee cultivated worldwide is C.
                arabica. Robusta strains also contain about 40–50% more caffeine than arabica. Consequently,
                this species is used as an inexpensive substitute for arabica in many commercial coffee blends. Good
                quality robusta beans are used in traditional Italian espresso blends to provide a full-bodied taste and
                a better foam head (known as crema).

                <b>Health:</b>Health effects
                A 2017 review of clinical trials found that drinking coffee is generally safe within usual levels of
                intake and is more likely to improve health outcomes than to cause harm at doses of 3 or 4 cups of
                coffee daily. Exceptions include possible increased risk in women having bone fractures, and a possible
                increased risk in pregnant women of fetal loss or decreased birth weight. Results were complicated by
                poor study quality, and differences in age, gender, health status, and serving size.

            </p>
            <p>
                In case of digestion.
                A 1999 review found that coffee does not cause indigestion, but may promote gastrointestinal
                reflux. Two reviews of clinical studies on people recovering from abdominal, colorectal, and
                gynecological surgery found that coffee consumption was safe and effective for enhancing postoperative
                gastrointestinal function.

                In case of Mortality.
                In 2012, the National Institutes of Health–AARP Diet and Health Study found that higher coffee
                consumption was associated with lower risk of death, and that those who drank any coffee lived longer
                than those who did not. However the authors noted, "whether this was a causal or associational finding
                cannot be determined from our data." A 2014 meta-analysis found that coffee consumption (4
                cups/day) was inversely associated with all-cause mortality (a 16% lower risk), as well as
                cardiovascular disease mortality specifically (a 21% lower risk from drinking 3 cups/day), but not with
                cancer mortality with exception being oral cancer mortality.
